# AkbankMLBootcamp
 This repository contains code for training machine learning models on the Red Wine Quality dataset using k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest algorithms. The models are trained and evaluated using randomized search for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques. The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset
The Red Wine Quality dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of various physicochemical properties of red wines along with their quality ratings.
